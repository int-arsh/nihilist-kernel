The Nihilist's Kernel

This project is a dialogue engine inspired by the characters Rust Cohle and Marty Hart from the television series True Detective.

In the context of this project, they investigate and delve into the profound, often unsettling, implications of technology and computer science.

Rust Cohle is a brilliant, nihilistic philosopher and detective who sees the world as a meaningless, inescapable cosmic trap. His worldview is deeply pessimistic, and he often expresses his thoughts through poetic, existential monologues.

Marty Hart is Rust's pragmatic and down-to-earth partner. He represents the common man's struggle to maintain a sense of order and meaning in a chaotic world. Marty frequently reacts to Rust's dark insights with frustration, confusion, and a desperate desire for normalcy.
